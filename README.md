# odin-recipes
My current project is a very basic recipe site, containing some of my favorite foods. 
I was more focused on practicing fundamentals rather than acutual recipes.
I also used this exercise to practice my Git Commit skills. 
The main skills aside from git were lists, adding images, and linking other pages.
