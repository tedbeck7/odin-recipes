    <p>This Italian Chicken recipe was a knock out at our families 4th of July party! It's a very simple recipe aimed at those of us who love great food but dont have the time to go overboard in the kitchen.</p>
    <p>This recipe recommends an outdoor grill, propane is easiest and preffered, but you may use a kitchen oven. Also, the marinade is best when left for 24hrs but a quick basting an hour before dinner will work in a pinch.</p>
